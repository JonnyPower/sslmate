  * Fix segfault on Ubuntu 14.10 by using external curl command for
    HTTP client.

  * Add `sslmate import` command for importing existing certificates to
    your account.
  * Add `sslmate list` command for listing your account's certificates.
  * Add `sslmate edit` command for changing the settings of a certificate

  * Add support for EV certs.
  * Add support for ECDSA keys and certs.
  * Add support for daily purchase limit.
  * Add wildcard_filename config option for setting the character used
    in a wildcard cert filename, instead of '*'.
  * buy/reissue/renew now exit with status 12 if cert is not downloaded
    and --no-wait is not used.
  * Print path to private key when buy/reissue terminates before cert
    can be downloaded.
  * Improve display of key and cert paths.
  * Preserve permissions of original .key file when reissuing.
  * Deprecate honor_umask config option.
  * Better support for non-ASCII domain names.

    that name already exists in your account.

v0.6.2 (2014-12-18)
  * Include recommended security settings when running `sslmate
    mkconfig`, unless --no-security option is specified.
    Recommendations are from the Mozilla Server Side TLS Guide.
  * Fix bug that could prevent full key/cert paths from appearing in
    mkconfig output.
  * Display a tip about mkconfig and test commands after buying a cert.

v0.6.1 (2014-12-03)
  * Fix an error with newer versions of Perl.

v0.6.0 (2014-12-03)
  * Add `sslmate test` command for testing the installation of a
    certificate.
  * Add `sslmate mkconfig` command for generating server configuration
    for a certificate.
  * Add --temp option to `sslmate buy` and `sslmate download`.  If
    specified, a temporary, self-signed, certificate will be installed
    instead of waiting for the real cert to be issued.  This temporary
    cert won't be trusted by clients, but can be used for configuring
    your server while you wait for your real cert to be issued.
  * Add --invoice-note and --email-invoice-to options to `sslmate buy`
    for customizing invoices.
  * Output non-error informational messages to stdout instead of stderr.
    stderr is now reserved for error messages only.
  * Strip private key and other cruft from certificate before importing.
  * Minor bug fixes.

v0.5.0 (2014-11-05)
  * Allow buy, import, and renew commands to be used non-interactively:
    - The --batch option disables prompting for confirmation.
    - The --email=ADDRESS option specifies the desired approver address.
    - The --no-wait option tells sslmate to return immediately
      instead of waiting for the new certificate to be issued.
  * Better support for key rollover in `sslmate reissue`:
    - The new key file is initially written to CN.key.new and the
      existing key file is only overwritten (by either `sslmate reissue`
      or `sslmate download`) once the new certificate is ready.
    - Existing .key and .crt files are overwritten even without the
      --force option, but only once the reissue completes successfully.
  * renew now overwrites existing .crt files even without the --force
    option. A safety check has been added to ensure that renew only
    installs a certificate if it matches the .key file.
  * API credentials are now saved to disk only if `sslmate link` is run
    explicitly. Other commands no longer implicitly link the system.
  * Minor bug fixes and internal improvements.

v0.4.5 (2014-10-27)
  * Support Perl when installed in a directory other than /usr/bin.

v0.4.4 (2014-10-27)
  * Add `sslmate req` command for generating a key and CSR.
  * Minor bug fixes.

v0.4.3 (2014-10-24)

    option set to 'yes'.
  * Re-license under the X11 license.
  * Minor bug fixes.

v0.4.2 (2014-10-20)
  * Fix bug that prevented 'sslmate link' from working with
    passwords containing '0'.

  * Ensure that `sslmate download` only downloads certs that
    match the corresponding private keys.
  * Improve usage messages.
  * Add support for configuration profiles.
  * Check for newer version when running `sslmate version`.
  * Rewrite in Perl.

v0.3.0 (2014-09-12)
  * Add `sslmate renew` and `sslmate download` commands, and
    --auto-renew and --no-auto-renew options to `sslmate buy`.
    See https://sslmate.com/blog/post/automating_renewals
  * Make years argument optional in `sslmate buy`; default to 1 year.
  * Add key_directory and cert_directory config options to set the
    location of purchased/downloaded files.  Defaults to $PWD for
    non-root users and /etc/sslmate for root.
  * Read default config options from /etc/sslmate.conf if it exists.
